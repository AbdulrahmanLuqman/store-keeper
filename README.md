# Store Keeper 📦

Store Keeper is a sleek and efficient mobile inventory management application built with React Native and Expo. It allows users to effortlessly track products by adding, editing, and deleting items, complete with images captured directly from the device's camera. All data is stored locally using SQLite, ensuring your inventory is always accessible, even offline.

## ✨ Features

-   **Product Management**: Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for your inventory items.
-   **Image Capture**: Use the device's camera to add photos to each product for easy identification.
-   **Local Database**: Utilizes Expo-SQLite for persistent local storage, making the app fast and offline-capable.
-   **Modern UI**: A clean, intuitive, and responsive user interface built with modern React Native components.
-   **Tab-Based Navigation**: Simple navigation powered by Expo Router for a seamless user experience.
-   **Centralized State**: Manages application state effectively using React Context API.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js (LTS version recommended)
-   Git
-   Expo Go app on your physical device or an Android/iOS simulator

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/store-keeper.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd store-keeper
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    or if you use Yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

4.  **Run the application**:
    ```bash
    npx expo start
    ```
    This will start the Metro bundler. You can then scan the QR code with the Expo Go app on your phone or run it on a simulator by pressing `a` for Android or `i` for iOS.

## 📱 Usage

Once the application is running, you can start managing your inventory:

1.  **View Products**: The home screen ("Products" tab) displays a list of all your current inventory items. If it's your first time, this screen will be empty.
2.  **Add a New Product**:
    -   Navigate to the "Add Products" tab.
    -   Tap the "Add Photo" placeholder to open the camera and take a picture of your product.
    -   Fill in the product name, quantity, and price.
    -   Click "Save" to add the item to your inventory.
3.  **Edit or Delete a Product**:
    -   From the "Products" list, find the item you wish to modify.
    -   Tap the **edit** icon (pencil) to open the form with the product's current details. Make your changes and tap "Update".
    -   Tap the **delete** icon (trash can) to permanently remove the product from your inventory.
